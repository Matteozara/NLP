from out of the surrounding darkness, there came a hail: “Schooner, ahoy!”\\n 7: It came again—a voice curiously throaty and inhuman, calling from somewhere upon the dark sea away on our port broadside: “Schooner, ahoy!”\\n 12: “You need not be afraid,” answered the queer voice, having probably noticed some trace of confusion in my tone.\\n 25: And then, a sudden indefinite suspicion, of I knew not what, coming to me, I stepped swiftly to the binnacle and took out the lighted lamp.\\n 28: As I did so, I heard a slight muffled cry, and then the sound of a splash, as though someone had dipped oars abruptly.\\n 33: But there came only the indistinct sounds of a boat being pulled away into the night.\\n 38: he asked, coming across the deck.\\n 41: From a long distance away there came back to us a faint reply, and my companion repeated his call.\\n 42: Presently, after a short period of silence, there grew on our hearing the muffled sound of oars, at which Will hailed again.\\n 43: This time there was a reply: “Put away the light.”\\n 45: “Come nearer,” he said, and the oar strokes continued.\\n 55: “Shut up a minute, old man,” he said, in a low voice.\\n 58: “See here, mister,” he said, “this is a pretty queer business, you coming upon us like this, right out in the middle of the blessed Pacific.\\n 63: As he finished, I heard the noise of the oars again, and then the voice came; but now from a greater distance, and sounding extremely hopeless and pathetic.\\n 66: The voice died away, and the sound of the oars, dipping irregularly, was borne to us.\\n 75: “Shove that lamp back in the binnacle,” said Will; then he leaned over the rail and listened.\\n 78: “Won’t you come alongside now?” asked Will in an even voice.\\n 89: “Is she—” “I have left her behind upon the island,” came the voice.\\n 92: “I know not its name,” returned the voice.\\n 95: “No!” said the voice, with extraordinary emphasis.\\n 106: “No—I dare not,” replied the voice, and it seemed to me that in its tones I detected a note of stifled craving—as though the owner hushed a mortal desire.\\n 107: It came to me then in a flash that the poor old creature out there in the darkness was suffering for actual need for that which Will held in his arms; and yet, because of some unintelligible dread, refraining from dashing to the side of our schooner and receiving it.\\n 114: In a minute a slight cry from the Invisible came to us, and we knew that he had secured the box.\\n 115: A little later he called out a farewell to us, and so heartful a blessing, that I am sure we were the better for it.\\n 126: “Listen!” said Will, a low note of excitement in his voice.\\n 130: They came to a stop a little distance off the broadside, and the queer voice came again to us through the darkness: “Schooner, ahoy!”\\n 132: “Yes,” replied the voice.\\n 137: Will began to make some reply, in a puzzled voice; but became confused, and broke off short.\\n 155: They were entirely callous, through fear, and when we came up upon the decks, we saw them only as small shapes afar off upon the horizon.\\n 159: “It was later, when I observed that we seemed to be in the way of some tide or current, which bore us from the ship at an angle; so that in the course of three hours, by my watch, her hull became invisible to our sight, her broken masts remaining in view for a somewhat longer period.\\n 163: Gradually it became plainer, and, somewhat after midnight, it appeared to sound upon either hand at no very great space.\\n 165: “When the morning came, we found that we were in a sort of great lagoon; but of this we noticed little at the time; for close before us, through the enshrouding mist, loomed the hull of a large sailing vessel.\\n 168: “The raft drew near to the ship, and we shouted on them to take us aboard; but none answered.\\n 170: Yet I had much ado to make my way up, because of a kind of grey, lichenous fungus that had seized upon the rope, and which blotched the side of the ship lividly.\\n 172: Here I saw that the decks were covered, in great patches, with grey masses, some of them rising into nodules several feet in height; but at the time I thought less of this matter than of the possibility of there being people aboard the ship.\\n 176: There was a great smell of staleness, so that I knew in a moment that nothing living was within, and with the knowledge, I shut the door quickly; for I felt suddenly lonely.\\n 179: Seeing me look down, she called up to know whether there were any aboard of the ship.\\n 180: I replied that the vessel had the appearance of having been long deserted, but that if she would wait a little I would see whether there was anything in the shape of a ladder by which she could ascend to the deck.\\n 185: Here and there, within the cabins themselves, we came across odd patches of that queer fungus; but this, as my sweetheart said, could be cleansed away.\\n 186: “In the end, having assured ourselves that the after portion of the vessel was empty, we picked our ways to the bows, between the ugly grey nodules of that strange growth; and here we made a further search, which told us that there was indeed none aboard but ourselves.\\n 193: Yet even thus early we became aware that our lot was even less to be desired than might have been imagined; for though, as a first step, we scraped away the odd patches of growth that studded the floors and walls of the cabins and saloon, yet they returned almost to their original size within the space of twenty-four hours, which not only discouraged us but gave us a feeling of vague unease.\\n 195: Yet, by the end of the week the growth had returned in full strength, and, in addition, it had spread to other places, as though our touching it had allowed germs from it to travel elsewhere.\\n 200: When I saw the thing upon her pillow I shuddered, and then and there we agreed to go right out of the ship and see whether we could not fare to make ourselves more comfortable ashore.\\n 201: “Hurriedly we gathered together our few belongings, and even among these I found that the fungus had been at work, for one of her shawls had a little lump of it growing near one edge.\\n 204: Yet, as we drew near to it, I became gradually aware that here the vile fungus, which had driven us from the ship, was growing riot.\\n 208: “At first, it seemed to us that there was no single portion of the surrounding shore which was not hidden beneath the masses of the hideous lichen; yet, in this, I found we were mistaken; for somewhat later, coasting along the shore at a little distance, we descried a smooth white patch of what appeared to be fine sand, and there we landed.\\n 213: Then we went back to the ship for such things as it seemed to us we should need.\\n 218: It was only a small circular spot, much like a little grey mole.\\n 237: After it was finished we sat together and talked awhile of many things; for there had come into our lives sudden, very terrible thoughts.\\n 243: “A month, two months, three months passed and the places grew somewhat, and there had come others.\\n 250: “With this determination and knowledge in our minds we knew that we should have to husband our food and water; for we did not know, at that time, but that we should possibly live for many years.\\n 253: But—but—” He broke off; then continued somewhat abruptly:  “As I was saying, we knew that we should have to use care in the matter of food.\\n 257: At this I was somewhat inclined to feel desperate until the thought came to me to try outside the lagoon, in the open sea.\\n 258: “Here, at times, I caught odd fish, but so infrequently that they proved of but little help in keeping us from the hunger which threatened.\\n 259: It seemed to me that our deaths were likely to come by hunger, and not by the growth of the thing which had seized upon our bodies.\\n 262: One morning, a little before midday, I came off from the ship with a portion of the biscuits which were left.\\n 266: Yet, on hearing my voice, she seemed confused, and, turning, slyly threw something toward the edge of the little clearing.\\n 278: “Later in the day, feeling strangely restless and much shaken with the thing which I had discovered, I made my way along one of the twisted paths—formed by the white, sand-like substance—which led among the fungoid growth.\\n 284: Abruptly, as I stared, the thought came to me that the thing had a grotesque resemblance to the figure of a distorted human creature.\\n 285: Even as the fancy flashed into my brain, there was a slight, sickening noise of tearing, and I saw that one of the branchlike arms was detaching itself from the surrounding grey masses, and coming toward me.\\n 310: You know the rest, and may God, out of His great heart, bless you for your goodness to a—a couple of poor outcast souls.”\\n 312: Then the voice came again, and for the last time, sounding through the slight surrounding mist, ghostly and mournful.\\n 320: I thought of a sponge—a great, grey nodding sponge— The oars continued to ply.\\n 324: Then the oars were dipped, the boat shot out of the patch of light, and the—the thing went nodding into the mist.\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":64}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from rouge import

times of religious gloom and intolerance lived Richard Digby, the gloomiest and most intolerant of a stern brotherhood.\\n',\n"," '1: His plan of salvation was so narrow, that, like a plank in a tempestuous sea, it could avail no sinner but himself, who bestrode it triumphantly, and hurled anathemas against the wretches whom he saw struggling with the billows of eternal death.\\n',\n"," '6: So Richard Digby took an axe, to hew space enough for a tabernacle in the wilderness, and some few other necessaries, especially a sword and gun, to smite and slay any intruder upon his hallowed seclusion; and plunged into the dreariest depths of the forest.\\n',\n"," '10: The farther he went, however, and the lonelier he felt himself, and the thicker the trees stood along his path, and the darker the shadow overhead, so much the more did Richard Digby exult.\\n',\n"," '13: In this manner, he journeyed onward three days and two nights, and came, on the third evening, to the mouth of a cave, which, at first sight, reminded him of Elijah’s cave at Horeb, though perhaps it more resembled Abraham’s sepulchral cave at Machpelah.\\n',\n"," '25: In regard to this cave it was observable that the roof, so far as the imperfect light permitted it to be seen, was hung with substances resembling opaque icicles; for the damps of unknown centuries, dripping down continually, had become as hard as adamant; and wherever that moisture fell, it seemed to possess the power of converting what it bathed to stone.\\n',\n"," '27: And here I am put in mind that Richard Digby, before he withdrew himself from the world, was supposed by skilful physicians to have contracted a disease for which no remedy was written in their medical books.\\n',\n"," '28: It was a deposition of calculous particles within his heart, caused by an obstructed circulation of the blood; and, unless a miracle should be wrought for him, there was danger that the malady might act on the entire substance of the organ, and change his fleshy heart to stone.\\n',\n"," '37: At the close of the third day, he sat in the portal of his mansion, reading the Bible aloud, because no other ear could profit by it, and reading it amiss, because the rays of the setting sun did not penetrate the dismal depth of shadow round about him, nor fall upon the sacred page.\\n',\n"," '38: Suddenly, however, a faint gleam of light was thrown over the volume, and, raising his eyes, Richard Digby saw that a young woman stood before the mouth of the cave, and that the sunbeams bathed her white garment, which thus seemed to possess a radiance of its own.\\n',\n"," '39: “Good evening, Richard,” said the girl; “I have come from afar to find thee.”\\n',\n"," '43: When he came a pilgrim to America, she had remained in her father’s hall; but now, as it appeared, had crossed the ocean after him, impelled by the same faith that led other exiles hither, and perhaps by love almost as holy.\\n',\n"," '57: “Come back with me!”\\n',\n"," '58: she exclaimed, clasping her hands,—“come back to thy fellow-men; for they need thee, Richard, and thou hast tenfold need of them.\\n',\n"," '61: “Perverse woman!” answered Richard Digby, laughing aloud,—for he was moved to bitter mirth by her foolish vehemence,—“I tell thee that the path to heaven leadeth straight through this narrow portal where I sit.\\n',\n"," '66: Mary Goffe, meanwhile, was leaning against a tree, beside the sepulchral cave, very sad, yet with something heavenly and ethereal in her unselfish sorrow.\\n',\n"," '68: Espying the bright fountain near at hand, she hastened thither, and scooped up a portion of its water, in a cup of birchen bark.\\n',\n"," '70: She then returned to the mouth of the cave, and knelt down at Richard Digby’s feet.\\n',\n"," '71: “Richard,” she said, with passionate fervor, yet a gentleness in all her passion, “I pray thee, by thy hope of heaven, and as thou wouldst not dwell in this tomb forever, drink of this hallowed water, be it but a single drop!\\n',\n"," '72: Then, make room for me by thy side, and let us read together one page of that blessed volume; and, lastly, kneel down with me and pray!\\n',\n"," '73: Do this, and thy stony heart shall become softer than a babe’s, and all be well.”\\n',\n"," '74: But Richard Digby, in utter abhorrence of the proposal, cast the Bible at his feet, and eyed her with such a fixed and evil frown, that he looked less like a living man than a marble statue, wrought by some dark-imagined sculptor to express the most repulsive mood that human features could assume.\\n',\n"," '76: But, the more heavenly she was, the more hateful did she seem to Richard Digby, who at length raised his hand, and smote down the cup of hallowed water upon the threshold of the cave, thus rejecting the only medicine that could have cured his stony heart.\\n',\n"," '77: A sweet perfume lingered in the air for a moment, and then was gone.\\n',\n"," '78: “Tempt me no more, accursed woman,” exclaimed he, still with his marble frown, “lest I smite thee down also!\\n',\n"," '80: No sooner had he spoken these dreadful words, than Richard Digby’s heart ceased to beat; while—so the legend says-the form of Mary Goffe melted into the last sunbeams, and returned from the sepulchral cave to heaven.\\n',\n"," '82: Above a century afterwards, when the trackless forest of Richard Digby’s day had long been interspersed with settlements, the children of a neighboring farmer were playing at the foot of a hill.\\n',\n"," '84: A little boy and girl, to conceal themselves from their playmates, had crept into the deepest shade, where not only the darksome pines, but a thick veil of creeping plants suspended from an overhanging rock, combined to make a twilight at noonday, and almost a midnight at all other seasons.\\n',\n"," '85: There the children hid themselves, and shouted, repeating the cry at intervals, till the whole party of pursuers were drawn thither, and, pulling aside the matted foliage, let in a doubtful glimpse of daylight.\\n',\n"," '87: Their father, unable to comprehend what had so startled them, took his axe, and, by felling one or two trees, and tearing away the creeping plants, laid the mystery open to the day.\\n',\n"," '88: He had discovered the entrance of a cave, closely resembling the mouth of a sepulchre, within which sat the figure of a man, whose gesture and attitude warned the father and children to stand back, while his visage wore a most forbidding frown.\\n',\n"," '92: There was something so frightful in the aspect of this Man of Adamant, that the farmer, the moment that he recovered from the fascination of his first gaze, began to heap stones into the mouth of the cavern.\\n',\n"," '96: Thus all traces of the discovery were obliterated, leaving only a marvellous legend, which grew wilder from one generation to another, as the children told it to their grandchildren, and they to their posterity, till few believed that there had ever been a cavern or a statue, where now they saw but a grassy patch on the shadowy hillside.\\n',\n"," '\\n']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":29}]}]}
